# Tic-Tac-Toe-No-Draw
This is a custom twist on classic Tic-Tac-Toe, built with Flutter. The game introduces a dynamic rule: each player can only have a maximum of 3 active symbols on the board at any time.

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Players**: Two players – X and O – take turns.
- **Board**: Standard 3x3 grid.
- **Symbol Limit**: Each player can place **up to 3 symbols** only.
- **Oldest Symbol Removal**: When a player places their 4th symbol, the **oldest one is automatically removed**.
- **Visual Hint**: The oldest symbol (next to be removed) is shown with **50% opacity**.
- **Win Condition**: Like classic Tic-Tac-Toe — align 3 of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal to win.
- **Sound Effects**:
  - `click.mp3` — Placing a symbol
  - `reset.mp3` — Resetting the game
  - `ka-ching.mp3` — Winning the game
